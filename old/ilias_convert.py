# Converting raw csv files into a format that can be easily copy-pasted into ILIAS, which is the LMS we use. This is for the homework data, which is scraped from the LMS and then converted into a format that can be easily copy-pasted back into the LMS, so that teachers don't have to do it manually. The function takes a file path as input and returns a string that can be copy-pasted into ILIAS. The string contains the student username, the number of uncorrected homework, and the links to the uncorrected homework.
